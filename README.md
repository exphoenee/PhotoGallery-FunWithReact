# Fun with React!

## The goal of the project

I made this little playgroud to learn React and to have fun with it. I'm not a React expert, so I'm sure there are better ways to do things. But I'm learning and I'm having fun!
The main goal was to learn the simplicity and reusability of React components. I also wanted to learn how to use the React Router to create a single page application.

## How to run

```
npm install
npm start
```

## How it works?

There is 2 users in the system:

- User: `user` Password: `user`
- Admin: username: `admin`, password: `admin`

You can register new users, but you can't register new admins.

## What can I do?

- Login
- Register
- Adding new photos, to the gallery
- Adding new posts
- Adding new comments to the posts
- Liking and disliking the posts
- Removing and updating the posts and comments (only by the author)

When you login, you can see the list of users. You can click on a user to see his details. You can also edit a user. If you are an admin, you can also delete a user.
